# Scoparella.Web

A front-end SPA (work in progress) for the Scoparella project - an Italian card game web app over-engineered with every buzz-word technology I could find on the shelf! ðŸ‘¹

## Run in dev

1. First install all dependencies using `npm i`.
2. Then build and run the app `npm run start`.

It's a single-page app, built with WebPack, and it uses live-server to server requests from the dist folder.
